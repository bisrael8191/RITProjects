									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computing has seen many rapid advances in both hardware and software. Quantum computing is the next evolutionary step in the progression of computer technology. It is the implementation of quantum bits, or qubits, to solve computational problems in ways that are impossible with traditional computing methods. Quantum computing offers us many significant benefits, albeit with a plethora of challenges. The nature of quantum computing theoretically lends itself well to certain computational problems that are not easily solved using classical approaches. With quantum computing, it is theoretically possible to solve many problems, such as factorization, in polynomial time as opposed to exponential. Other unique advantages include entanglement and parallelism. Challenges that we must overcome include interference, reversibility, and measurement of states. These advantages and challenges are largely derived from the unique ability of a qubit to have a state of 0 and 1 simultaneously. This presentation will cover the history of quantum computing, the challenges it faces, the applications in which it may be applied, the unique implementation of programming in a quantum environment as well as the future of quantum computing.
