									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grover's Algorithm was developed in 1996
									by Lou Grover of Bell Labs to improve the search time of an unsorted database. His algorithm called
									for an oracle or blackbox that would basically be able to store and retrieve bits and be able to achieve
									a superposition. This oracle described a quantum computer. Using a quantum computer and Grover's 
									algorithm, the averge search time of database with N entries was determined to be O(n^1/2). This means
									that if the database had 100,000 unsorted entries, a specific entry could be found in 100 steps. On a classical
									computer, this feat would take an average of 50,000 steps. Grover's algorithm has also been modified to solve
									other problems like finding a key to decrypt an encrypted message, mean and median estimation, the collision
									problem for many-to-one functions, and helping to solve NP-Complete problems. See the Resources page
									to download many papers about Grover's Algorithm and many links to explain it in detail<br>
