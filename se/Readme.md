##Whack Whack Math Attack
Whack Whack Math Attack is a network-enabled children's math game that can help younger students learn to 
add/subtract, multiply/divide, and units places. This project was done as a small group of 5 people and was 
designed, tested, programmed, and packaged in 10 weeks. Our group worked together using group meetings for 
design tasks and CVS for group programming. The result was an extremely successful end product, that met or 
exceeded all of our expectations and serves as a great example of our software engineering ability. Take a look 
at the screenshots below to get a feel for the game and then feel free to download the Windows installer or 
source code to run it yourself!
