# A sample AOS program that reads in values for
# variables a, b, c, d, and e, echo prints these
# values, and then implements the multiple
# assignment statement
#
#	F = G = H = -(A*B) + (C/D) - (A%E)
#
# Data areas
#
A	BSS	1
B	BSS	2
C	BSS	3
D	BSS	2
E	BSS	1
F	BSS	1
#
# Subroutines
#
# Read a number and store it at the
# address found on the stack
#
In	READ	Get the number
	STAL	Save it, but leave a copy on the stack
	RET
#
# Print the number found on top of the stack
#
Out	PRT
	RET
#
# More data areas

#
# Input initial values
#
